# My Resume App
A simple interactive mobile version of my resume. 


## Features

- Portrait/Landscape Mode
- Cross platform



## Codebase Description
It attempts to make use of the Model-View-ViewModel Architecture 
although for now,  there's no business logic but the different screens 
are separated into different views. In order to avoid boilerplate code,
the constant widgets, were separated and imported when needed. Also,
The app should is written in a way that it can be easily extended with new features.
## Design Description
    Design inspiration was gotten from these sites.

will be an added update later.
